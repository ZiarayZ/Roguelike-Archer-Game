# Some Archer Thing
Uses Python 3, pygame and tkinter
Can probably do without tkinter, only used as the options in the beginning
In the future i might make an options function to recall it midgame or whatever
wasd to move or arrow keys
space to roll
mouse to aim - sensitivity is high af as i create a small image that the mouse is on and scale it to the resolution
probably wont change that ^^^
left click and hold to draw, let go to shoot, the longer it draws the more power it has, maximum of 1 second, minimum of 0.25 seconds
sounds are incredibly loud even on volume 1, feel free to change that or just ignore it and have it on 0
if you don't have python there is the launch.bat and program.exe that = the python code
feel free to use it for what you want but don't be a dick about it, ty x
