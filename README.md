# Some Archer Thing
Uses Python 3, pygame and tkinter<br />
Can probably do without tkinter, only used as the options in the beginning<br />
In the future i might make an options function to recall it midgame or whatever<br />
wasd to move or arrow keys<br />
space to roll<br />
escape to quit<br />
mouse to aim - sensitivity is high af as i create a small image that the mouse is on and scale it to the resolution<br />
probably wont change that ^^^<br />
left click and hold to draw, let go to shoot, the longer it draws the more power it has, maximum of 1 second, minimum of 0.25 seconds<br />
sounds are incredibly loud even on volume 1, feel free to change that or just ignore it and have it on 0<br />
